# J-Music
Lightweight audio player application that can play wav and mp3
files a user has downloaded to their machine.

Set to undergo revamping over next few months.

Core Updates include:
- core rewrite and mp3 support
- new gui and file explorer

The goal is to create a full fledged application that any type
of user can download and comfortably user whilst being lightweight.
