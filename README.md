# record-player-java

Summary:
* This is a simple audio player application built in Java and Java Swing.
* This project is very basic, it does not come with audio files already.
* If you would like to add your own files:
	* First, put them in the res/playlist folder
 	* Second, set path to file by passing it into RecWin() at the bottom of Menu.java
* I'm currently no longer working on this project, however I plan to rewrite it sometime soon.
* NOTE: Button images on actual audio player were lost when I restored this project.
